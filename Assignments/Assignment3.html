Feeling uninspired
Forgetting brilliant ideas
I started a new job today,    and I started to question my decision to change careers. I was thinking of not coming back, that's how overwhelmed I feel. I think I'm extremely hard on myself, and expect that I should automatically know the job, or I feel like the people I work for feel that I should know it already. I'm used to "knowing" what to do and how to do it, I hate making mistakes and I will beat myself up about it for days.
Some days the anxiety gets so bad I just wanna throw up. I don’t wanna quit though because I know how amazing this opportunity is but I wonder if I’ll be able to survive this
during the course of the day I zone out and I’m not retaining all the information that’s being given to me. I feel as though I sometimes as for things to be repeated so much that it’s embarrassing.

As I mentioned it has only been 1 week but I find myself questioning why I’m there. The passion that other colleagues have for the role I don’t have it and the pay is why I’m really doing it

helped me adapt to stress (like how an adaptogen feels), gives me more energy (but not like in a stimulant like way, like caffeine), and has also helped me cognition and focus, especially when it comes to things like college work
 everyone began to notice i was more patient and pleasant

Felt like superwoman

focused while working on big projects, no crash and no headaches.
start tasks and complete all my goals
 spend more time reading books and eliminated most of my time spent using screens (social media, video games, Netflix)

Writers block
Everything is a new process and there is still so much to learn. I can almost hear my boss getting frustrated as she’s training me on simple things. It’s not that I don’t know; it’s just that I am so overwhelmed that I can’t think straight.
mental fogginess
easily distracted





Solution
What does the avatar need to do to overcome the key roadblock?
“If they <insert solution>, then they will be able to <insert dream outcome>”
